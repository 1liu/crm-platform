### Database Setup
1. If PostgreSQL isn't already running, start it & sign in.
    ```shell
    $ sudo service postgresql start
    $ psql
    ```
2. While signed into PostgreSQL, create a **new database** using the following SQL command.
    ```sql
    create database "crmPlatform";
    ```
3. Still signed into PostgreSQL, create a **new user** and remember the credentials. You'll be needing them for the configuration file.
    ```sql
    create user "crmPlatform" with password 'superstrongpassword';
    ```
4. Still signed into PostgreSQL, give your new user full control over your new database with the following SQL command.
    ```sql
    grant all privileges on database "crmPlatform" to "crmPlatform";
    ```
5. Sign out of PostgreSQL with the following command. You should be returned to your bash prompt.
    ```sql
    \quit
    ```

3. Copy the `.env.example` file & name it `.env`.
